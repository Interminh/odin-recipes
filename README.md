# odin-recipes
A recipe website based on the Odin project's curiculum. 
I wanted to incoporate three main dishes, an appetizer, a soup, and a sandwhich from Vietnam, my culture. The index page is a bit blank, but I will try to spice it up with CSS once I have those tools. For now, please enjoy Spring Rolls, Pho, and Banh Mi.
