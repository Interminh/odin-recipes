    <h3>How to make Spring Rolls</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>   
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes; drain and set aside to cool.</li> 
        <li>Fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip one wrapper into the hot water for 1 second to soften.</li>
        <li>Lay wrapper flat; place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center, add some cooled noodles, lettuce, mint, cilantro, and basil, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on each side.</li>
        <li>Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with lettuce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>To make the chili sauce for dipping: Mix water, lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and chili sauce in a small bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>To make the second sauce for dipping: Mix hoisin sauce and peanuts in a separate small bowl.</li>
        <li>Serve spring rolls with the two sauce mixtures.</li>
    </ol>
